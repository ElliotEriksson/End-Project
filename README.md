# Train Calculator

My end project in PRRPRR1 during the spring term 2022.

## The Project

It is a calculator that helps you figure out the time it takes for a train of your choice to travel a line of your choice.
You can also add your own train and lines that you can use later.

The program allows you to compare the time it would take for different trains to travel a across a ceratin line or one train to travel across different lines.

The calculator calculates the time it would take including all the acceleration and deceleration all the way to a stand still.
But it does not it include additional stoppage at the stations to pick up and drop off passangers.
Nor does it include potential extra weight of added carriages, luggage, passangers etc.
The calculator is not live based and therefore cannot take potential traffic in to account.
